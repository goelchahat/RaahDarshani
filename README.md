### Description
##### Problem
People who are visually impaired face no shortage of problems in India. Blind people use canes, but the traditional cane can't detect objects higher than the waist.
##### Solution
An IoT based solution to detect the proximity as well as the type of hurdle. The person while holding his mobile device records a video. We perform real time object detection and use an IR sensor to detect the distance of the object. The application according to this input warns the user of the obstacle.
### Tech Stack
* nodejs
* Arduino
* C++
##### APIs Used
* IBM Watson for object detection
* (say) for text-to-speech
